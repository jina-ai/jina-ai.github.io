{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Search ALL the things: We're running a meme contest for Jina 2.0","date":"2021-05-31","slug":"meme-contest","author":"Alex C-G","content":"<p>For Jina 2.0, we listened to the community. Truly, deeply listened. \"What are your pain points?\" we asked, eagerly anticipating valuable feedback from our loyal community. We speculated wildly in private:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Could it be that Executors are too hard to use?\"</li>\n<li>\"What's the deal with Drivers anyway? What were the team smoking?\"</li>\n<li>\"Why the Hell does a Document look like a chocolate bar?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But no. What did we hear, loud and clear, ringing from the lips of our community? They want more memes. All that bloody effort we poured in, and that's the answer they come back with? It made us literally do this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/blog/meme_contest/facepalm.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Did all of the above actually happen? No. But is it a funny and hopefully endearing story that will make our company look human and more likeable? Also, no.</p>\n<p>Sod it. At this point, why not?
