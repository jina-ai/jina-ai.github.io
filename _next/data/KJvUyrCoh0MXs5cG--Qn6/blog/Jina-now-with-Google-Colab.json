Super easyyyy, no fuss needed, let's get to it!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Just tell me how!</h2>\n<p>This is really straightforward, in this example we'll index some data for you to see how to run it with Google Colab, so you will see how to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Jina</li>\n<li>Import Jina Flow</li>\n<li>Create a Flow</li>\n<li>Index your data</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>1. Install Jina</h3>\n<p>The first thing is to create a notebook in Google Colab. You can do that <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">here</a> and install Jina via <code>pip</code> with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">!pip install jina \n</code></pre>\n<p>And you should have something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vV0ba1xHVChWUjkdD6I09Q.png\" alt=\"install jina\"></p>\n<h3>2. Import Jina Flow</h3>\n<p>Then we need to import our Flow:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from jina import Flow\n</code></pre>\n<h3>3. Create a Flow</h3>\n<p>Now that we have Jina installed and we imported our Flow we can start using it. This is business as usual:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_fluffy_flow = Flow()\n</code></pre>\n<p>But let's try to make it a bit more interesting by adding two Pods, one for the Encoder and one for the Indexer:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_fluffy_flow = Flow().add(name='encoder').add(name='indexer')\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we should have something like this:\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3kugo4nJ6LAxiRQMbLYFQA.png\" alt=\"Create a Flow\"></p>\n<p>Now, this is a simple example, but if you do more fancy stuff, you might want to check how your Flow is looking, so you can do that simply by referring to the name of your Flow, for example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZIPj4mU-2uDFwdBTYMocWw.png\" alt=\"Plot Flow\"></p>\n<p>There you can see we indeed have two Pods one after the other.</p>\n<h3>4. Index your data</h3>\n<p>Okay, so we have our Flow ready with two Pods, now it's time to index some simple data. This is as simple as:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EXr1RSCB6FmCdXnSN0_P_w.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And you are done! If you run this you will see that your indexing will start:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nl9ZYQA0HSQD_eH3-8z6MQ.png\" alt=\"Indexing\"></p>\n<p>This was a very simple demonstration of what you can do, but because Google Colab is so interactive, it makes it a very powerful tool to run any of the ideas you might have.\nIf you want to run this example this is all you need:</p>\n<pre><code>!pip install jina                                                           #Install Jina\n\nfrom jina import Flow                                                       #Import Flow\nmy_fluffy_flow = Flow()                                                     #Create Flow\n\nmy_fluffy_flow = Flow().add(name='encoder').add(name='indexer')             #Add Pods\n\nmy_fluffy_flow                                                              #Display Flow\n\nwith my_fluffy_flow:                                                        #Index Data\n    my_fluffy_flow.index(['Who is the prettiest cat])   \n\n</code></pre>\n<p>As always, get in touch if you have any questions, comments or pics of your cat you want to share with us.
