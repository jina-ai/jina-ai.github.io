This unlocks support for running Jina in <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyter/notebook\">Jupyter Notebook</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython\">IPython</a>. <a href=\"https://docs.jina.ai/api/jina.clients.asyncio.html#jina.clients.asyncio.AsyncClient\"><code>AsyncClient</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.jina.ai/api/jina.flow.asyncio.html#jina.flow.asyncio.AsyncFlow\"><code>AsyncFlow</code></a> were added to let users manage <code>eventloop</code> and make Jina more reliable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyter/notebook\">Jupyter Notebook</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython\">IPython</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ease of Use</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Add <code>MultiModalDocument</code> as primitive type. This lets users build a multimodal search system in a Pythonic way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Introduce <code>Runtime</code> as a member of <code>Pea</code>, defined as \"a procedure that blocks the main process once running, therefore must be put into a separated thread/process. The new architecture greatly improves the readability and maintainability of the code.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>üôè Thanks to our Contributors</h2>\n<p>This release contains contributions from Amritpal Singh, Bithiah Yuan, CatStark, Cristian Mitroi, Deepam Patel, Deepankar Mahapatro, Florian H√∂nicke, Han Xiao, Harry Stark, Hidan, Joan Fontanals, Nan Wang, Pratik Bhavsar, Rutuja Surve, Sergey M, Siyuan Shi, Szymon Skorupinski, Tadej Svetina, Wang Bo, Yannic Kilcher, Yusup.</p>\n<h2>üôè Thanks to our Community</h2>\n<p>And thanks to all of you out there as well!
