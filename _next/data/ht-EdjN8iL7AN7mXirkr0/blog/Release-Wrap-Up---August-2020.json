They grow up so fast!</p>\n<p>So, needless to say, we’re excited to share the highlights of our release notes.</p>\n<p>We’re just sharing a smattering of highlights here. Be sure to click through for the full notes!</p>\n<h3>Jina Search 0.5.0</h3>\n<p>Jina Search provides the core of our neural search framework.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recursive Document structure</li>\n<li>Native data querying capabilities</li>\n<li>Migration of Executors to Jina Hub</li>\n<li>Support for Mindspore</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/releases/tag/v0.5.0\">View full release notes</a></h4>\n<h3>Jina Dashboard 0.1.0</h3>\n<p>Get insight on running tasks in Jina. With Dashboard, you can analyze logs, design Flows and view Jina Hub images.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View log stream. When running a Jina instance with log server enabled, you can view logs output by your instance in the <code>log stream</code> tab by connecting it to the Dashboard in the <code>settings</code> tab.</li>\n<li>Monitor Tasks. You can view network load, queries per second, and messages sent and received by your Jina instance in the <code>task</code> tab.</li>\n<li>View and Edit Flows. In the <code>flow design</code> tab, you can view the Flow of a running instance, import a Flow in YAML format, edit and export a Flow in YAML format.</li>\n<li>Explore the Hub. In the <code>hub</code> tab, you can view available images, and explore more information about each one such as setup instructions, README's, and build history.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard/releases/tag/v0.1.0\">View full release notes</a></h4>\n<h3>Jina Hub 0.1.0</h3>\n<p>A centralized registry of custom and community-driven Jina Apps and Pods that are tailored to specific use cases of neural search.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have decoupled the Core (Jina Search) and Hub into two projects. They are maintained under two different repos ( <a href=\"https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/\">jina</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-hub\">jina-hub</a> ) and controlled by two different CIs. They are connected via <code>git submodule</code>, i.e. <code>jina-hub</code> is a <code>submodule</code> of <code>jina</code>.</li>\n<li>We have clarified the file structure of “a valid Hub executor”, and established best practices for developing a new Hub executor. We’ve also refactored all Executors from the core into this new structure.</li>\n<li>We have improved the CLIs for maintaining Hub executors: there is a new interface <code>jina hub new</code> (create new Hub Executor), and improvements on the <code>jina hub build</code> interface.</li>\n<li>Finally, a new Github Action <code>hub-builder</code> has been released to <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jina-hub-image-builder\">Github Marketplace</a> and integrated into the CI of <code>jina-hub</code> to ensure the validity of every Executor</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-hub/releases/tag/v0.1.0\">View full release notes</a></h4>\n","coverImage":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*XZ6tdNtdFnMPJ8VxPhOEwA.gif","tags":["Release Wrap Up"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
