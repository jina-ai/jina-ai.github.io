This unlocks support for running Jina in <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyter/notebook\">Jupyter Notebook</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython\">IPython</a>. <a href=\"https://docs.jina.ai/api/jina.clients.asyncio.html#jina.clients.asyncio.AsyncClient\"><code>AsyncClient</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.jina.ai/api/jina.flow.asyncio.html#jina.flow.asyncio.AsyncFlow\"><code>AsyncFlow</code></a> were added to let users manage <code>eventloop</code> and make Jina more reliable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyter/notebook\">Jupyter Notebook</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython\">IPython</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ease of Use</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Add <code>MultiModalDocument</code> as primitive type. This lets users build a multimodal search system in a Pythonic way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Introduce <code>Runtime</code> as a member of <code>Pea</code>, defined as \"a procedure that blocks the main process once running, therefore must be put into a separated thread/process. The new architecture greatly improves the readability and maintainability of the code.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🙏 Thanks to our Contributors</h2>\n<p>This release contains contributions from Amritpal Singh, Bithiah Yuan, CatStark, Cristian Mitroi, Deepam Patel, Deepankar Mahapatro, Florian Hönicke, Han Xiao, Harry Stark, Hidan, Joan Fontanals, Nan Wang, Pratik Bhavsar, Rutuja Surve, Sergey M, Siyuan Shi, Szymon Skorupinski, Tadej Svetina, Wang Bo, Yannic Kilcher, Yusup.</p>\n<h2>🙏 Thanks to our Community</h2>\n<p>And thanks to all of you out there as well!
