Traditionally, methods like BM25 or tf-idf have been used to rank search results based on keyword matching. Recent methods, such as embedding-based cosine similarity, have been implemented in many vector databases. These methods are straightforward but can sometimes miss the subtleties of language, and most importantly, the interaction between documents and a query's intent.

This is where the "reranker" shines. A reranker is an advanced AI model that takes the initial set of results from a search—often provided by an embeddings/token-based search—and reevaluates them to ensure they align more closely with the user's intent. It looks beyond the surface-level matching of terms to consider the deeper interaction between the search query and the content of the documents.`,what_is_answer_long_ending:"The reranker can significantly improve the search quality because it operates at a sub-document and sub-query level, meaning it looks at the individual words and phrases, their meanings, and how they relate to each other within the query and the documents.

Traditional methods, which relied on rigid, rule-based systems, fell short because language is too complex and fluid. Enter text embeddings: a powerful solution that translates text into a language of numbers—specifically, into vectors in a high-dimensional space.

Consider the phrases "sunny weather" and "clear skies." To us, they paint a similar picture. Through the lens of embeddings, these phrases are transformed into numerical vectors that reside close to each other in this multi-dimensional space, capturing their semantic kinship. This closeness in the vector space is not just about words or phrases being similar; it's about understanding context, sentiment, and even subtle nuances in meaning.

Why is this breakthrough important? For starters, it bridges the gap between the richness of human language and the computational efficiency of algorithms. Algorithms excel at crunching numbers, not interpreting texts. By converting text into vectors, embeddings make it possible for these algorithms to 'understand' and process language in a way that was previously out of reach.

The practical applications are vast and varied. Whether it's recommending content that resonates with your interests, powering conversational AI that feels surprisingly human, or even detecting subtle patterns in large volumes of text, embeddings are the key. They enable machines to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and much more, with an understanding of language that is increasingly nuanced and refined.`,open_tensorboard:"Open visualizer",visualization_example:"Embedding all sentences from this section to a 3D vector space",visualize_done:"Visualization is done, you can now click the top button to open the visualizer.",more_than_two2:"Please enter more than two documents, i.e. more than two lines.",generating_visualization:"Generating visualization...",query:"Query",document:"Document",pairwise_test:"Pairwise",search_hint:"Type to search within the sentences listed below",original_documents:"Sentences to embed",total_documents:"Embedding progress: {_Processed}/{_Count} sentences.",embedding_done:"Successfully embedded {_Count} sentences.",please_fill_docs_first:"Please first enter some sentences below before search.",original_documents_hint:"Enter your sentences here.

Furthermore, our Base model excels in several tasks, including classification, pair-classification, re-ranking, and summarization, outperforming OpenAI’s model.",question8:"How seamless is the transition from OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 to your solution?",answer8:"The transition is streamlined, as our API endpoint, https://api.jina.ai/v1/embeddings, matches the input and output JSON schemas of OpenAI’s text-embeddings-ada-002 model. This compatibility ensures users can easily replace the OpenAI model with ours when using OpenAI’s endpoint.",question9:"How tokens are calculated when using jina-clip-v1?",answer9:`The tokens are calculated based on the text length and image size. For text in the request, tokens are counted in the standard way. For image in the request, the following steps are conducted:
1.	Tile Size: Each image is divided into tiles of size 224x224 pixels.
	2.	Coverage: The number of tiles required to completely cover the input image is calculated. Even if the image dimensions are not perfectly divisible by 224, we will count partial tiles as full tiles.
	3.	Total Tiles: The total number of tiles covering the image determines the cost. For instance, if an image is 500x500 pixels, it would be covered by 3x3 tiles, resulting in 9 tiles.
	4.	Cost Calculation: Each tile contributes to the final cost of processing the image. The cost per tile is 1000 tokens.

Example:
For an image with dimensions 500x500 pixels:

	•	The image is divided into 224x224 pixel tiles.
	•	The total number of tiles required is 3 (horizontal) x 3 (vertical) = 9 tiles.
	•	The cost will be 9*1000 = 9000 tokens`,question17:"Do you provide models for embedding images or audio?",answer17:"Yes, jina-clip-v1 can embed both images and texts.
